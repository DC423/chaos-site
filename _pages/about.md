## What is Distributed Chaos?
Distributed Chaos is an independent, community-driven project. We are not affiliated with any single organization, group, or platform.

Our goal is to provide a central hub where infosec communities can post events, share socials, and publish articles. We also aim to offer a generic framework to help reduce the mental, logistical, and financial overhead of starting, growing, and sustaining a community.

Anyone is welcome to contribute, list their group, or publish content through the platform. Groups already affiliated with other organizations (2600, DefCon, B-Sides, CitySec, etc.) are more than welcome to participate. If you're building something aligned with our core values, we want to support you.

## Core Values
1. Participation should be open to anyone, regardless of background or affiliation.  
2. Groups should avoid language that implies exclusive ownership of their community.  
3. Distribution of knowledge should be free and accessible to all members.  

## History
Distributed Chaos was born from the recognition that many infosec communities exist in isolation, often without representation in larger networks. We launched in 2025 with the goal of creating a shared framework that could remain open and inclusive of all current and future groups. Our intention is not to replace existing networks, but to help strengthen the backbone of the broader infosec and hacker community.
